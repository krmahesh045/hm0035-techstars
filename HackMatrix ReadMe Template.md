## Develop a streamlined platform for addressing the lack of personalized mentorship using efficient mentor matching, and ensuring tailored and effective mentorship experiences.

## Description
The solution should help solve the lack of mentorship in education. Many students struggle to find mentors aligned with their goals and interests. Existing systems often lack efficiency and user-friendliness, affecting mentor-student connections. Because there is not any such platform, students cannot get guidance specific to their individual needs. This problem requires the development of a system that allows students to easily input their preferences and provides a smoother process for mentor matching, ensuring personalized, effective mentorship experiences for educational and career growth.
